If you want to help with translations:

Make a copy of en.php and save it as xx.php, xx being the
language identifier, e.g. fr for French, it for Italian, etc.

Visit https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php
to lookup your language ID if you don't already know it.

Edit xx.php and mail a copy to @author given in en.php.

Subject: Lang_XX_PHP_Easy_Comments
Body   : @author Your Name yourmail@server.com
Attach : xx.php
