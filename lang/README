If you want to help with translations please:

- Make a copy of the English language file
- Save the copy as xx.php (where xx is the language code)
- Translate the text strings only!
- Send your translation to the address given in @author

Once your translation has been accepted and you are the sole author
your name will appear in the @author token. If you are a co-author
then your name will appear in a @coauthor token.
